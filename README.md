 ❄️ Frozen Lake AI – Q-Learning Reinforcement Learning Project

Welcome to our AI-powered solution to the classic *Frozen Lake* challenge using *Q-learning*, a fundamental Reinforcement Learning algorithm.

## 👥 Team Members
- Sanika Patil  
- Asmita Waghmare  
- Prajkta Nannikar  
- Snehal Vhankande

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how an agent can *learn to navigate* a slippery 4x4 grid world (Frozen Lake) using *trial and error* and *Q-learning*. The agent is rewarded for reaching the goal while avoiding holes.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- OpenAI Gym (FrozenLake-v1)  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib

## 🔎 Key Features
- Environment setup using OpenAI Gym  
- Implementation of Q-learning algorithm  
- Training loop with exploration vs exploitation strategy  
- Performance visualization  
- Final Q-table analysis    

## 🎯 Outcome
- The trained agent successfully navigates the lake.
- Q-table reflects optimal actions after enough episodes.
